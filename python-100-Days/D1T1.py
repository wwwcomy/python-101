The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
Python之禅 - Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
美丽比丑陋更好
Explicit is better than implicit.
明确比含蓄更好
Simple is better than complex.
简单比繁杂更好
Complex is better than complicated.
繁杂比复杂更好
Flat is better than nested.
扁平比内嵌更好
Sparse is better than dense.
=。=
Readability counts.
可读性很重要
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
特殊情况并不是打破规则的借口
Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.
错误永远不应当被默默处理
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
如果你的实现很难给别人解释明白，那估计这个实现不太好
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
